# Low cost Passive (camera) and Active (LIDAR) Vision for Obstacle Depth

Example of disparity map created by stereo correspondence through two images and a point cloud map created by LIDAR data values (distances measures).

## Sensors used
- Two HP Webcam HD-4110
- One LIDAR Lite V2
- Two Micro Servo SG90 (to makes LIDAR rotations)
